	From the end of ice age to the 21st century, humanity experienced the countless rise and eventual fall of civilizations around the world. Various different cultures, system of governances, religions have all engraved their mark across contients before they are wiped off, by the single constant in the equation: the forever evolving technological advancements. As nations and civilizations rised and fell through the centuries, we saw how technological advancements transformed the civilizations that existed. For example, the creation of telegram provided a new method of cross continental communication and rapid communication, allowing for much faster strategic transitions during war time and better support for the soldiers during battles. Or the creation of firearms that paved way for the European dominance in the 17 century. As we glide into the beginning of the ‘20s, many questions arise: are we about to experience the next transformative technological advancement that will change our civilization? Will it not only be the downfall of our civilization, but also the downfall of humanity?

	This revolutionary technology is AI, first being developed at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence(DSRPAI) Slowly, AI programs began to show incredible promise in problem solving and speech recognition as they further directed resources and focus into this field. Siri, a daily virtual assistant that all Apple users know, was an incredible AI milestone which displayed how AI grew to be able to recognize speech patterns and language and process these languages to execute commands needed. Soon after, virtual assistants and chatbots like Alexa from amazon or Tay from Microsoft all begin to push the boundaries of AI, becoming more and more realistic and pushing the limit of holding conversations with normal people. At the start of the ‘20s an AI company called OpenAI came out with the GPT-3, which was able to generate tweets, summarize essays, answer questions and even write computer programs automatically.GPT-3 and many of the modern AIs are neural networks, which are modeled after the web of neurons in the human brain, they analyze thousands of online data to find patterns within these human interactions to create their responses to every and anything. Through these new technologies, researchers and developers begin to fantasize the possibilities of sentient AI, which are AI’s which are able to perceive, think and feel after taking in information, rather than finding statistical information within the data point.  However, some researchers state that Sentient AIs are still eons in the making and will not be achieved soon.

	Disregarding the disagreement on the possibility of Sentient AI in the near future, discussion regarding Sentient AI has been on the rise as the AI industry continues to transform many industries, ranging from home services to car manufacturing. One discussion that has been occurring is that Sentient AIs will overflow our society with premium goods and services and eventually result in the downfall of humanity, while the other side argues that Sentient AIs will continue to our society as examplified by current AI implementations such as Tesla autopilot or tracking human trafficing footprint throughout the webs.

	Throughout the development of AI, researchers globally warned the danger of AI, esepecially Sentient AI. Stephen Hawking even went as far as warning how fully developed AIs would "take off on its own, and redesign it-self at a ever increasing pace" (BBC, 2) Eventually, the pace of the AI's self development will overcome our slow human progression of technology and ideaology and will cause a mass exctinction. Not beacuse Sentient AI's will develop evil emotions, rather that it is the best course of action for them to progress further. To put it in a simpler term, I will never go out of my ways to squish ants or kill small animals, but when my stomach is rumbling at the middle of the night and I desparately wants some delicious, finger licking good, McDonald's chicken nuggets, I might drive over ants or animals on my way there by accident. Similarly, when Sentient AI's reaches a certain stage of self realization and development, their actions might result in depletion of resources that humans need to survive, such as sunlight or minerals. I believe that as examplified above, if fully developed, sentient AI will bring downfall of human civilization.
