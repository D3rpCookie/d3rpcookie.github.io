      <br>

      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p> There was an bit of issue with our collective slide show regarding the mvp. We had to host a in person meeting after school during one of the break days in order to organize and talk through all our current ideas in regards of what the minimal product would do programatically.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>There's no scheduling challenges this week, as everyone was able to find the time to work together. We were able to get many done and figure out what is the next step after creating our cad and assembling our current design.
</p>

      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 13-Feb-2023 </h1>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p> We have finalized the minimal design in cad and have begun to analyze our cad to ensure it is up to date. However, it became an apparent issue of having to share CAD files with members that have less mechanical knowledge, as they aren't able to navigate the cad as well as some of us.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>There's not many challenges occuring with scheduling this week, we have been progressing along the pace we expected to take and is currently expected to finish on time.  
</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Interpersonal Challenges </h4>
      <p>I had zero issue with anyone involved with this project this week. Some of us learned how to use the minimal of the CAD program solidedge 2023 from others in order to view the cad/design of the product at hte current stage.</p> 
      <br>

      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 6-Feb-2023 </h1>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p>We have encountered issues with the Electronic Speed Controller of the design and have to deviate from the previous controller to try to find another one that fits the requirements that we currently have better. The older ESC that we have picked was sold out and could not obtain one. </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>As our robotics build season continue to progress and we are about to enter competition season, we are expecting at least a bit more delay in the development side and design side of the roller skates, however, we should still be able to have V1, the base model, ready to manufacture this upcoming week. 
</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Interpersonal Challenges </h4>
      <p>I had zero issue with anyone involved with this project this week. We discussed the possibilities of looking at other ESC Controllers as the technical challenge occured smoothly with little to no disagreement.</p> 
      <br>

      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 23-Jan-2023 </h1>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p>We had been progressing in our development, however, the main mechanical designer of the system is currently all busy preparing for their robotics competition season. This resulted in a slow of mechancial progress and thus causing us to fall behind on our schedule.      </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>As mentioned above, we have encountered problems in delays due to outside influences and interactions. This will result in us beling delayed by a few days and possibily weeks. 
</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Interpersonal Challenges </h4>
      <p>I had zero issue with anyone involved with this project this week. We talked about the possbility of going forward with the programming section of the system while waiting on the whole mechanical issue to be solved.</p> 
      <br>

      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 16-Jan-2023 </h1>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p>During our development of the project this week, we have not encountered any technical issues regarding specifically to the design nor the programming of the project. However, the internet in the location which we worked, the Allen STEAM Center, was not being maintained properly throughout the week, causing many internet outages where we could not access the internet to continue our design/work.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>
	There is no current schedule conflicts nor challenges, however, we are at the stage where our team is slowing down in the production as most of the memebers are a part of the robotics team whose competitive season recently started. This might pose as a challenge for the future but currently we are still maintaining decent pace to finish on time. 
</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Interpersonal Challenges </h4>
      <p>I had zero issue with anyone involved with this project this week, we had some lovely conversations within our group chats about ourselves and it allowed me to learn more about my teammates. 
      </p> 
      <br>

      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 9-Jan-2023 </h1>
      <br>

      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Technical Challenges</h4>
      
      <p>
	One technical challenge we have encountered this week was making the spring of the electrical roller blade adjustable to account for various weights of the users. This occurs as we had planned the roller blades to have suspension for us to navigate and turn easier while having the roller blade being soft on our feet. Therefore, we had a spring on the bottom of the roller blades, however due to the nature of the roller blades spring, people that are heavier than the certain weight could not use the roller blade, therefore, we had to redesign some parts of the physical design to ensure the adjustability. </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Scheduling Challenges </h4>
      <p>
	We didn't have any scheduling problem as we were priorly already ahead of schedule, therefore we had plenty of time between our next deadline and now to iterate and develope before we approach deadline. 
</p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Interpersonal Challenges </h4>
      <p>I had zero issue with anyone involved with this project, we had some very thoughtful discussions as a team during our meeting time and I was able to learn about my project memebers during our time in class. 
</p> 
      <br>
      
      <h1 style="Color:#FFF;"> 2-Jan-2023 </h1>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Software Development Engineer </h4>
      <br>
      <p>
	A software development engineer is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software products. This includes writing code in various programming languages, debugging issues, and collaborating with other team members to deliver a finished product. In a project development team, the SDE may work on a specific feature or module of the software, and will typically be involved in the entire software development lifecycle, from design and development to testing and deployment.</p>
      <p>I will likely not be fitted to this role compared to the other roles offered, as my technical experience and knowledge is not as deep nor wide compared to others within our project development team. I can overcome this if necessary by researching into the topics when needed and preparing myself prior to the project by going through tutorial books and similar examples of it. </p>
      <br>
      
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> QA Engineer</h4>
      <br>
      <p>A QA engineer, or quality assurance engineer, is a member of a project development team who is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software being developed. This involves designing and implementing test plans and cases, executing tests, and analyzing and reporting on the results. QA engineers work closely with software development engineers to identify and fix defects, and may also be involved in user acceptance testing and other types of testing to ensure that the software meets the required specifications and is fit for purpose. In a project development team, the QA engineer plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and reliability of the software, and helps to ensure that it meets the needs of the end users.</p>
      <p>I will likely be decently fitted for this role compared to the previously mentioned role of Software Development Engineer, as this was something I had a small amount of past experience with. Thoughout that experience, I learned about several topics and lessons which I can implement onto this project if needed. I will encounter more complications as there is more personalities on this team compared to the previous teams and I will have to enforce the QA and code formatting harder when necessary. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Project Manager</h4>
      <br>
      <p>A project manager is a person who is responsible for planning, organizing, and managing resources in order to successfully complete a project. The project manager may be responsible for setting project timelines and milestones, assigning tasks to team members, and ensuring that the project stays on track and within budget. They may also be responsible for communication with stakeholders, risk management, and quality control. In order to be effective, a project manager must have strong leadership and communication skills, as well as the ability to work effectively with a team and handle multiple tasks and responsibilities concurrently.</p>
      <p>I will likely be fitted to this role pretty well as I had several experiences on timeline management and ensuring that we can deliver a product on time. However, I will encounter several difficuties on the topic of getting products complete on time as we have some very interesting personalities on our product team. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;"> Product Manager</h4>
<br>
      <p>A product manager is a person who is responsible for the development and success of a product. The product manager works closely with the development team to define the features and requirements of the product, and to ensure that the product aligns with the overall goals. The product manager may also be responsible for market research. To be effective, a product manager should have a strong understanding of the market and the competition, as well as the ability to communicate effectively with a variety of development teams and workers as well as leading cross-functional teams.</p>
      <p>I will likely not be fitted for this role as this is not a project I originally had the idea for. I would much rather let the person who envisioned it first lead as they would definitely have the most idea of what the product would look like. If I were to take on this role, I will probably face challenges such as a lack of direction and not getting everyone to align with the decided direction. However, I can fix that by ensuring that I am reminding myself what our direction is everyday either through mental or physical daily remainders. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:#FFF;">Release Engineer</h4>
      <br>
      <p>A release engineer is a person who is responsible for the building, testing, and deploying of software releases. This may include automating the release process, setting up and maintaining build and test environments, and coordinating with development and QA engineer to ensure that releases are stable and of high quality. In addition, the release engineer may be responsible for managing source code control, branching and merging strategies, and other activities related to version control. To be effective, a release engineer should have strong technical skills, including familiarity with a variety of programming languages and tools, as well as excellent problem-solving and communication skills.</p>
      <p>I will liekly not be the best fitted for this role as we have people who are much more talented with git and github than me. However, if I were to take up on this role, I would face many challenges involving git repo as I lack quite a bit of knowledge in how it functions and don't exactly understand how it would work for a team this size. However, I can probably fix my conflict by researching the topic prior to the start of the project and ensuring that I have a structure in mind and running it by the people who are more knowledgeable in these topics.      </p><br>
